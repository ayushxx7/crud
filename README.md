### Tech Stack

#### MongoDB - Database

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database and uses JSON-like documents to store information

#### Node.js - Backend

- Node.js is an asynchronous JS runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that can execute JS outside a browser.

#### React.js - Frontend

- React.js is a UI/UX Library that uses the concept of Virtual DOM to rerender elements without requiring the need to reload the whole page whenever any update happens.

##### Note:

- Backend and Frontend will be hosted on separate servers
